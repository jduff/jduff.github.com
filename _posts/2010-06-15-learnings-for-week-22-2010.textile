* grep -rl 'structure_dump' . to recursivly search through a folder for the given string. mvim `grep..` to open them up.
* alias ls='ls -GF' so that ls is colored in all consoles.
* "nvarchar in SQLServer":http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186939.aspx takes a limit from 0 to 4000 OR the keyword MAX. MAX != 4000, it is actually much larger.
* When using Rails and the JDBC adapter queries SQLServer for nvarchar columns it gets the value back for limit, which when created with MAX is much larger than a limit you can use. This comes up when trying to create the database from schema.rb (testing).
* "Phocus":http://github.com/mynyml/phocus gem to temporarily focus some tests, ignoring all others, even across test classes.
* "Harmony":http://github.com/mynyml/harmony provides a simple DSL to execute javascript + DOM code within ruby.
* "Holy Grail":http://github.com/mynyml/holygrail execute browser-less, console-based, javascript + DOM code right from within your Rails test suite.
