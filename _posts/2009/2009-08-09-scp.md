I don’t have to do this often but every time I need to scp something up
to an EC2 server I forget the options and have to waste 10 minutes
finding it. Here it is so I don’t need to look for it anymore.

{% highlight bash%}
  scp -i PRIVATE_KEY LOCAL_FILE USER@IP:REMOTE_LOCATION
{% endhighlight %}

These [two](http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/scp.1.asp)
[links](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php) have a number of other
examples and list some of the other options.
