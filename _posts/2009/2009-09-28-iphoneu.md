For the past couple weeks a few of us at work have gotten into watching
screen casts while having our lunch. There have been a variety of topics
so far include one on
[MacRuby](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rubyonosx/rubyonosx2009-02-hotcocoa_introduction-rich_kilmer.m4v)
and another on [HTML5](http://www.vimeo.com/6691519). Most of the time
though it’s been some sort of
[iPhone](http://icodeblog.com/2009/09/15/introduction-to-mapkit-in-iphone-os-3-0/)
[programming](http://videos.71squared.com/6381001) screen cast, the
staple being the Stanford [iPhone Application
Programming](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php)
lectures.

Not only is this a lot of fun (yes, I am a big nerd and think a video on
HTML5 is fun) but I find that learning a new programming
language/framework/etc really helps with your day to day work. Every
programming language does things a little differently. When you embrace
the methodologies of a new language it can open your eyes to different
ways of looking at the programming problems you might face, no matter
what technologies you’re using.

On top of just watching the Stanford lectures they have all the [notes
and assignments
online](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php) so we’ve
been working away at those in the evenings. I’ve started posting my
solutions to GitHub and will continue to update them as we progress.
[HelloPoly](http://github.com/jduff/HelloPoly) and [Presence
2](http://github.com/jduff/Presence/tree/V2) are completed so far, check
them out if you’re interested.

If you are interesting in programming for the iPhone or just want to try
something new I’d defiantly recommend the [Stanford iPhone
lectures](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php). The
final version of the Presence assignment ends up being a full blown
Twitter client with threading, contacts integration, search and much
more.

Take the initiative and have your own Lunch and Learns.
