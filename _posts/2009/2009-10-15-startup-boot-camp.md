A couple weeks ago I heard about an event called [Startup Boot
Camp](http://www.theottawanetwork.com/startup-boot-camp/) that is
happening in Ottawa October 23-25th. The idea is to bring together a
number of startup minded individuals and form teams around startup
ideas. You then take the weekend to work on the idea and at the end the
best one gets a prize to be used to incorporate the business. Here is an
excerpt from the [blog post announcing the
event](http://www.theottawanetwork.com/startup-boot-camp/).

> The event will place 75-100 people into functional business teams
> around ideas for businesses. The participants, composed of developers,
> business managers, start-up enthusiasts, marketing gurus, accountants,
> lawyers, graphic artists and other roles will work together during the
> week end. At the end of 54 hours, they will have turned a business
> idea into a business plan ready to start on the Monday. A review panel
> at the end of Sunday’s presentation’s will determine which of the
> opportunities is the best developed and award a prize of $5,000 as the
> first seed money to start the business (e.g. incorporation costs,
> start a website, etc.). Similar networking events have evolved very
> successfully in other parts of North America with this one being the
> first in Ottawa.

I’ve just signed up and anyone else who might be interested should [do
the same](http://tonstartupoct09.eventbrite.com/). Even if you don’t win
the prize and [land your dream
job](http://jduff.github.com/2009/10/08/my-ideal-job/) it should be a
great opportunity to meet with like minded individuals and have some
fun.
