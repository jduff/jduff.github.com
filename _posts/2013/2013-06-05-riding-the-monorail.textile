A few months ago I had the amazing opportunity to speak at "BigRubyConf":http://www.bigrubyconf.com. This is a new ruby conference all about people doing big things with ruby and it was amazing. It was great to get together and talk to people who are dealing with the same or similar problems that we do at "Shopify":http://www.shopify.com with running large Rails applications.

One interesting thing I started to notice when talking to all these developers with applications at a similar scale to "Shopify":http://www.shopify.com (code and/or traffic wise) is they often referred to it as their 'monorail'. This came up again a couple of times when I was at "RailsConf":http://www.railsconf.com as well. This was a new thing to me and as I talked to more people the meaning of this term became clearer and clearer.

When people used the term 'monorail' they were referring to their single, core rails application. This is usually the application that the company started with. This is also the application that they are often chipping away at to turn into services. This is all well and good, the interesting part to me was that almost everyone who referred to their 'monorail' did so in a negative way. This was the application that was really hard to deal with, or that they were breaking apart into services or the code was really complicated and scary.

So, back up a bit, I said we have a similar sized application at "Shopify":http://www.shopify.com but we don't refer to it as our 'monorail'. We have a few services around it, supplementary apps etc, but still we don't call the largest of them a 'monorail'. What do we call it? It is 'Shopify Core'. Another interesting point is we don't refer to 'Shopify Core' in a negative way, I am extremely proud of this application and the code that it holds. I tell all developers, even non developers, that this holds the answers to all the questions you may have about "Shopify":http://www.shopify.com or how to do just about anything in Ruby or Rails. "Chances are the problem you are trying to solve has been solved in Shopify Core". Since "Shopify":http://www.shopify.com has been in development for almost a decade, started even before version 1.0 of Rails, then it is likely the git history holds the solution to most Ruby / Rails problems in ANY version of Rails. I find this incredible.

I guess the big question to ask is why do we look at Shopify Core so differently? I would imagine the applications have a similar amount of code and complexity, what makes us different? I think a big part of this is the fact that "Shopify":http://www.shopify.com has been built and is still being driven by a team that holds a lot of value in writing quality code. We even recently started a rotating team of developers where when you are on that team your mandate is to reduce technical debt and improve the quality of the code base. This is time when we don't work on features and make the code base better. Awesome.

Now, we're not all magical developers that write perfect code. Far from it. I think the difference is that we are able to and encouraged to go back and improve things. I've heard Tobi talk often enough about how while he was learning to program his mentor would often rip apart his code and ask him to throw it away and write it again. This leads you to not being tied to the code you write; it's just a tool to get a task done. This is a concept that Tobi and the rest of the team tries to ingrain in developers. Once you get this it is much easier to throw away a piece of code and rewrite it. It also helps that the core development team that wrote most of the code that "Shopify":http://www.shopify.com launched with is still at the company.

Do I have a good answer for why we look at Shopify Core differently? Not really. I have no concrete reason for why look at our core code base so differently than other companies. It might have to do with the focus on quality, or maybe not being tied to the code you write. It might be the type of people we hire, or the culture of the company itself, I really don't know. To be honest it doesn't matter to me that much; I'm happy that I work on a code base that I can be proud of and that I enjoy working with everyday, that's all that really matter to me.
