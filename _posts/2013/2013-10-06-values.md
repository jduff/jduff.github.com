![Values](/images/posts/2013-10-06/values.jpg "Values")

A few months ago I was introduced to this blog post by [Luc
Levesque](http://luclevesque.com/) titled [How to help new employees be
rockstars, a new
approach](http://luclevesque.com/post/15881999207/how-to-help-new-employees-be-rockstars-a-new-approach).
In this post Luc talks about his “Blueprint to Luc and his Quirks” which
outlines the things that are important to him and some of his particular
quirks. Luc then gives this to his new employees and goes over it with
them when they start so that they understand a bit more about him and
how he works. The idea is that if there are no surprises, all the
expectations and potential quirks are put out there straight away, then
there will be less questions about how someone new should react or how
Luc will react to particular actions.

I thought this was a great idea and a tool that I could make use of for
myself at [Shopify](http://shopify.com). This should be considered a
constant work in progress, I am constantly changing the way I work and
what I take on, so it only makes sense that some of my values and quirks
will change along with that.

### The Values, or quirks, of John Duff

**Caring**  
I care about Shopify and what we are doing. I jump on things that need
to be done, dig into problems and make Shopify better. I’m around when
issues come up. I fight for code quality and correct solutions.

**Responsiveness**  
Being responsive allows us to move at incredible speed. I might not get
back to your email or question a minute later (often I will), but you
will hear something within the day. Making sure people have the
information they need is super important to me. I use my phone for
email, code review and everything in between so that I can always
respond.

**Ownership**  
When I tackle a problem I try to understand every aspect of it. I think
about the solution and what it will mean in the long term. There are
endless interesting things to do at Shopify, but completing one of them
is worth more than starting ten. Have the determination to see things
that matter through to completion.

**Growth**  
I am always trying to improve and am constantly pushing myself. I take
on as much as I can handle, then I ask for a bit more. By pushing myself
and what I am capable of, I am learning and growing - and so is Shopify.

**Passion and Drive**  
I love what I do. Shopify is my startup, it is as important to me as
anything I would start on my own. I am invested in our success and the
success of everyone on the team.

**Doing it**  
If I see something broken, I fix it. If someone needs help, I help them.
I don’t complain, I get in and do something about it. I do what I think
is right first and ask for permission later.

**Insatiable Curiosity**  
I ask questions about what I am doing if I’m not sure. I am always open
to new ideas or solutions. I like to back things up with data or
alternatives and question the necessity of features and changes. Every
decision is mutable.

I found it a great exercise to even just come up with these values, let
alone share them with everyone. Big thanks to
[Luc](http://luclevesque.com/) for providing the inspiration for this
and [Cam Gregg](https://twitter.com/CamGregg) for suggesting I give this
a shot.
