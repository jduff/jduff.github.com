Learnings for the past week.

* more vim fun
** zf5j to fold the next 5 lines
** zo to open a fold
** zc to close a fold
** c in visual block to substitute
** ctrl+_ to complete html tag (with closetag plugin)
** ctrl+w+_ to maximize splits vertically
** ctrl+w+| to maximize splits horizontally
** ctrl+w+= to equalize splits
* after_initialize in a ruby model if you want something to happen when both new or create are called
* instance_eval can be given a block. This is really powerful if you want to whip up a quick DSL to clean up some code (highly recommended).
* Devise authentication plugin dropped support for MongoMapper until it conforms to ActiveModel (MongoMapper is in turn waiting until Rails 3 is final before making this change)
