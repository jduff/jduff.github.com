Learnings for the past week.

* vim (I made the switch this week!)
** ctrl+v to enter visual mode (useful for block comments)
** :sp to split a window
** :vsp for vertical split
** :A for alternate file (rails plugin)
** snipmate for awesome snippets ("plugin":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540, "snippets":http://github.com/scrooloose/snipmate-snippets)
** * searches for current word
** :%s/search/replace/modifiers
*** if you leave search blank it uses your previous search
*** g modifier for global search, c to confirm each replacement (very useful!)
* autotest doesn't run in ruby 1.9.1
** It fails for me saying "set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug" and that's about all
* ruby -e "code to run"
* assert_select('input', 0) doesn't work, need to use (assert_select 'input', :count=>0)
** This is confusing since assert_select('input', 5) works just fine

That's it for this week. If I find some time I'll post my vim config and talk about that a bit and maybe discuss what I did about autotest not working.
