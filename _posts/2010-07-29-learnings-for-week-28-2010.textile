* To get ActionMailer to work with GMail I needed to add the :enable_starttls_auto: true option "to the mailer configuration":http://www.justinball.com/2009/06/25/sending-email-with-ruby-on-rails-2-3-2-and-gmail/

* You can "add global gem options to ~/.gemrc":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1381725/how-to-make-no-ri-no-rdoc-default-for-gem-install, which is just a yml file
** ex. gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc

* SQLServer compatibility mode doesn't make the server behave exactly what is specified, rather, it pulls in any functionality that may have been deprecated in the later releases (I think)

* "SendGrid":http://sendgrid.com/, "Google Apps":https://www.google.com/a/, "AuthSMTP":http://www.authsmtp.com/ are paid services that can be used for sending email so you don't need to do it through your own server (or if you're on EC2 and can't reliably send mail from your server)
