* A couple of interesting resources for getting rid of alias_method_chain in your code "here":http://gist.github.com/413965 and "here":http://yehudakatz.com/2009/03/06/alias_method_chain-in-models/
** The basic idea in both of these is to create a module that defines the method you want to chain and call super in your redefinition. When you include the module into your class the modules method is insterted right above the instance's class in the inheritance tree.
* jQuery "nextAll":http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/ and "prevAll":http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/ functions to get all following/previous siblings of each element in the set of matched elements
** "next":http://api.jquery.com/next/, "nextUntil":http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/, "prev":http://api.jquery.com/prev/ and "prevUntil":http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/ are in the same family
* cmd-shift-t reopens last closed tab in the web browser (chrome, firefox, safari).
* A selected like 'input + label' matches all the labels that are directly beside an input. There is no way, with the same markup, to target the inputs directly beside a label ('input - label' someday, maybe?)
