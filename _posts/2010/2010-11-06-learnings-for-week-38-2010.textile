Not much for learnings for a couple weeks so skipping a few.

* Rails error messages can be cleaned up so that the user isn't overloaded by adding the simple helper described <a href='http://codebeef.com/removing-duplicate-error-messages-in-rails'>here</a>

* Setting up an app to authenticate with Facebook using <a href='http://github.com/plataformatec/devise'>Devise</a> is really straight forward. We have a sample Rails 3 app <a href='http://github.com/jduff/facebook_devise'>right here</a> that you can check out.
