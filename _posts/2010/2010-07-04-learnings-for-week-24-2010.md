-   Latest Rails 3 beta doesn’t work in ruby 1.9.1, as stated in [the
    release
    notes](http://guides.rails.info/3_0_release_notes.html#rails-3-requires-at-least-ruby-187)
-   Mongrel doesn’t build in Ruby 1.9.2.preview3 on Snow Leopard (for me
    at least)
-   Factory Girl factories don’t autoload in Rails 3 anymore, do it
    yourself or use [factory\_girl\_rails
    gem](http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails)
-   Colored grep: grep —color=auto
-   Vim visual block I ctrl-r-+ to insert copied text
-   IRB.conf\[:SAVE\_HISTORY\] = 100
-   :set spell in Vim to [turn on spell
    checking](http://tips.webdesign10.com/vim/how-use-vims-spellchecker)
-   [Ruby do…while
    loop](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/136793/is-there-a-do-while-loop-in-ruby)
    begin; code; end while(true)
