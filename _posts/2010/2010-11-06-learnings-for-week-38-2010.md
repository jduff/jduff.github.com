Not much for learnings for a couple weeks so skipping a few.

-   Rails error messages can be cleaned up so that the user isnâ€™t
    overloaded by adding the simple helper described
    <a href='http://codebeef.com/removing-duplicate-error-messages-in-rails'>here</a>

<!-- -->

-   Setting up an app to authenticate with Facebook using
    <a href='http://github.com/plataformatec/devise'>Devise</a> is
    really straight forward. We have a sample Rails 3 app
    <a href='http://github.com/jduff/facebook_devise'>right here</a>
    that you can check out.
