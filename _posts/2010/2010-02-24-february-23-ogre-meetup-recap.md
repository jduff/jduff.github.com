I’d like to thank everyone who came out to the latest meeting, we had
quite the turnout! A few new faces as well which is always great.

For anyone who doesn’t know “OGRE” stands for “Ottawa Group of Ruby
Enthusiasts”. We’re a local group that gets together on the fourth
Tuesday of each month to talk about Ruby, programming, cool projects and
sometimes even Python. We’re a fairly diverse group from professional
Ruby developers, to tinkerers, people just starting out and everything
in between. Check out the [website](http://www.ottawaruby.ca/) and the
[google group](http://groups.google.ca/group/ogre-list) for more info.

This past Tuesday we had Don Kelly and Julie Hache giving a couple
presentations. To recap:

1.  Don Kelly talked about TreeTop
    ([http://treetop.rubyforge.org/](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/)) and
    LLVM ([http://llvm.org/](http://llvm.org/)) giving us a short
    example of writing a very simple language with both. He also spent a
    bit of time showing us the SEXP parser and interpreter
    ([http://github.com/karfai/sexp](http://github.com/karfai/sexp))
    that he was working on with both of those tools. Very cool stuff.

1.  Julie Hache gave a presentation on some of the stuff that has
    changed with Rails 3 and what the upgrade process is going to look
    like. She also walked through how we can get setup and playing with
    Rails 3 right now with the beta
    ([http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/2/5/rails-3-0-beta-release/](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/2/5/rails-3-0-beta-release/)).
    Julie also mentioned a book that Jeremy McAnally just released with
    over 100 pages of info on the Rails 3 upgrade process
    ([http://www.railsupgradehandbook.com/](http://www.railsupgradehandbook.com/)).
    Jeremy knows his stuff so I’m sure it will be $12 well spent.

At the end of the night Bryan Larsen gave another mention of the recent
Hobo release
([http://hobocentral.net/blog/2010/02/23/hobo-1-0-released/](http://hobocentral.net/blog/2010/02/23/hobo-1-0-released/))
so we should all check that out.

Once again, thanks to Julie and Don for doing the presentations and
thanks for everyone who came out. We look forward to seeing all of you
next month!
