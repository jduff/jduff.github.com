* Git interactive rebase can reorder commits (just reorder them in the file)
* "No such device eth0" after cloning VMWare Image
** run 'sudo mv /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules.old' and then restart the machine to fix the problem. Found "here":http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2008/07/13/vmware-siocsifaddr-no-such-device-eth0-after-cloning/.
* "Any word completion with vim":http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Any_word_completion
** type some characters then ctrl-N or ctrl-P (next or previous match)
* "EngineYard App Cloud":http://www.engineyard.com/products/appcloud makes a lot of mundane server admin tasks very simple and still allowing complete customization with chef scripts or with root access on the server.
* Many EC2 IPs are on Spam blacklists. Use a thirdparty such as gmail to do the emailing for you.
