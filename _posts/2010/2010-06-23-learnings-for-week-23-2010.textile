* Recently needed to ignore some files that were already being tracked by git. "This Link":http://pivotallabs.com/users/rolson/blog/articles/1278-ignoring-tracked-files-in-git helped me out.
** git update-index --assume-unchanged config/database.yml
* HTML5 'type=search' renders a nice search box and degrades to a simple input in older browsers.
* HTML5 'placeholder=text' renders placeholder text into an input that goes away when you click into it.
* case; when 'one', 'two'; to match 'one' or 'two' in a Ruby case statement.
* Rails hide_action :action_name in a controller will prevent the action from being routed to.
* jQuery "input" event gets fired when typing, pasting, cutting etc. from an input field.
* jQuery live != livequery plugin. Main difference is live can only bind an event handler to the matching elements, livequery can run a function every time another element matches.
