* If you need to access Git on a remote machine and can't add an ssh key from that machine to the server adding a few options to the .ssh/config should do the trick:{% highlight bash %}
User jduff
Host git.server.com
{% endhighlight %}If you then ssh to the machine passing the -A option (to forward the agent) git should work perfectly.

* In windows Run => \\tsclient (Terminal Server Client) will list network drives

* With Rails 3 unobtrusive Javascript (using <a href='http://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs'>jquery-ujs</a>) adding 'data-remote=true' and 'action=URL' attributes any input element can be made to do an ajax request without any extra work.

* <a href='http://github.com/tomas-stefano/infinity_test'>infinity_test</a> is an alternative to <a href='http://ph7spot.com/musings/getting-started-with-autotest'>Autotest</a> that uses <a href='http://github.com/mynyml/watchr'>Watchr</a> and <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>RVM</a> allowing you to easily run your tests against multiple rubies at once.
