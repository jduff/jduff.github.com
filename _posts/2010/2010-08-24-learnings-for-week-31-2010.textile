Here's my learnings from a couple weeks ago.

* "jQAPI":http://www.jqapi.com/ - alternate location for JQuery documentation. Also provides offline versions you can download as "HMTL":http://www.jqapi.com/jqapi-latest.zip or an "Adobe Air application":http://github.com/downloads/erikzaadi/jqapi/jQAPI-1.4.2.air?v=11072010.

* "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ is a package manager for OS X. Packages are defined by formulas that are simple Ruby scripts which is stored in Git underneath.

* Older browsers "do not have a native JSON parser":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1364842/json-is-not-defined-chrome but this can be patched with <a href="http://www.JSON.org/js.html"> a little bit of javascript from json.org</a>. We ran into this when working with <a href="http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit/">WireIt</a> which does include the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/json/">Yahoo JSON parser</a>, but doesn't actually use it everywhere. Adding in the version from json.org works as a stopgap before digging through all of WireIt.

* Ran into an issue calling to_json on a an object that has a carrierwave attachment and have <a href="http://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave/issues/closed#issue/41">commented on an issue for it</a>. I am running Rails3 RC2 and using FileSystem storage. To get around this I'm simply excluding the file attachment from the to_json:{% highlight ruby %}
recipe.to_json(:except=>:photo)
{% endhighlight %}
