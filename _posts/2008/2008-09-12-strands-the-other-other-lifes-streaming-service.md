A little while back I heard some chatter on
<a href="http://friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a> about
<a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">another</a>
<a href="http://socialthing.com/">life</a>
<a href="http://www.socialmedian.com/">streaming</a>
<a href="http://secondbrain.com/">service</a> that had just come out and
was 'FriendFeed but better'.  Naturally I had to check it out and take a
look for myself to see what all the hype was about over
<a href="http://strands.com">Strands</a>.  I created my account, added
some services and friended some people.  That night I spent a couple
hours checking out peoples feeds and clicking around.  I hadn't looked
in again until tonight, almost a month later.

There's a lot of competition in the feed aggregation or life streaming
area these days so you really have to be innovative to catch peoples
interests.  <a href="http://friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a> came a long
at just the right time to catch people with a very solid offering before
they were committed to something else.  Anyone else coming into this
space really need to take the hints from the current leaders and really
<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/push-the-envelope.html">push
the envelope</a> to be able to pull users from services they've now
become attached to.

</p>
<p>

<a href="http://strands.com">Strands</a> did a very good job of picking
up where some of these other services had left off.  Trendwatch,
recommendations and a 'hot posts' list are all things that most other
services are missing.  They also had friend groups before FriendFeed
added their
<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/friendfeed_beta_interface.php">lists
feature</a>.  All these features sounded great to me I jumped ship to
check it out.

</p>
<p>

I said earlier that will the competition out there newer life streaming
companies need to push he envelope, which Strands has done, but they
also need to take the lead from the services that already exist.  This
is where Strands dropped the ball.  One of the things everyone raves
about with FriendFeed is how simple and streamlined the interface is. 
There's no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutter">clutter</a>,
just your content.  This is where I feel Strands misses the target.

</p>
<p>

Everything in Strands is so bulky.  The graphics are bulky, there's lots
of empty space, about the only thing that isn't bulky is the content
stream, the one thing that should be.  On my homepage I can see two
post, that's it.  What am I looking at other than my content?  Pictures
of the people I follow, menus and a whole lot of white space.  A service
that is used to view the aggregated data of your friends should really
put that content front and center, as much as it can, because at the end
of the day that's why I'm there.

</p>
<p>

All in all <a href="http://strands.com">Strands</a> did a pretty great
job of coming up with some new and interesting features but they need to
work on the presentation before it will become useful.  With it's
current design it seems like they're trying to give all the features and
areas of the site the same amount of play, but all features are not made
equal.  They need to think about what people are really coming to the
site for and put that in the forefront.
