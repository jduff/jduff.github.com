So, I’ve finally started blogging, this is something I’ve been wanting
to do for almost a year now but work and life have managed to keep me
too busy up to now.  This is my first post here so It makes sense to
tell you a little about who I am and what I’m interested in so you know
what you’re getting into by reading this blog.  It feels a little
strange though, logically I should introduce myself right at the start
but right now there’s no one listening so does it really matter? 
Anyways, hopefully someone will someday go back into the archives and
find this introductory post helpful.

My name is John Duff, I live in Canada’s capital city, Ottawa and work
full time as a Software Developer.  I graduated Carleton University in
2006 from Software Engineering.  I’m currently working with Ruby and
Rails for the most part but have done a fair bit of Java, .Net,
Javascript and Flex programming as well.  At the moment I have a bit of
a fixation with FriendFeed and various other Social  
Media outlets and am very interested in what is happening with cloud
computing. I’m also dabbling in design (photoshop, illustrator,  
css) a bit more as well as keeping up with what is happening in the  
Ruby community.
