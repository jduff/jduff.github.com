<p>This is the story of how I finally got around to signing up to a blogging service and getting that first post up there.&nbsp; It isn't all that exciting; there wasn't any lighting, an explosion or even a bear attack, but this is my blog and my story so I'm going to tell it.</p>

<p>About a year ago things finally clicked together that as a software developer I should probably be showcasing my work and what I know, building a brand as it were.&nbsp; It had nothing to do with the <a href="http://inspired.entrepreneur.com/2007/11/05/how-can-you-build-your-brand-with-a-blog/">countless</a> <a href="http://kalsey.com/2003/06/build_your_brand/">posts</a> on <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/product-reviews/brand-yourself-a-sponsored-review-of-quicksprout/">building</a> your online <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/06/09/how-to-build-your-personal-brand-through-your-blog/">brand,</a> it just came to me.&nbsp; I swear.&nbsp; Around this same time I came across a couple of developers talking about how building your blogging engine is a good way to showcase your work and try out new ideas with your development (can't find any links anymore).&nbsp; This really appealed to me; there's always something new coming along and work isn't always the best place to try every shiny thing.&nbsp; So I got started.&nbsp; About a year ago.</p>

<p>I got going at a fair clip on things, was working with the latest version of Rails (2.0 at that time) which was neat because they've added a lot of <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/81">interesting</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brynary/whats-new-in-rails-2/">things</a>, but then life pulled me away.&nbsp; I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/2820011262/">got married</a>, so a lot of time was spent planning that, we <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/2737074670/in/photostream/">bought a house</a> and we even moved in.&nbsp; It's been a crazy year.&nbsp; Even with everything going on I'd still try and pull a minute or two away to work on things.&nbsp; I even managed a pretty decent design and logo.</p>

<p>Then I read <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/08/be-your-start-up.html">this article</a> by Jay Fields, someone I really respect within the rails community, on blogging.</p><blockquote><p>Don't roll your own, you don't need the maintenance headache.</p></blockquote><p>Hm.&nbsp; Ya, shit, he's right.&nbsp; It's been fun playing around with building the blog, but I wasn't getting anywhere (though I did end up with a 17 message thread in gmail of post ideas).</p>

<p>With my new direction I did some research and decided on using <a href="http://www.typepad.com">Typepad</a> to host my blog.&nbsp; Now things aren't quite how I'd like them (I don't have full control over the html with the plan I got) but hey, at least I'm here.</p>
