I'm really looking forward to leaving tomorrow afternoon for Orlando
Florida to attend <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf 2008</a>, it
should be a blast.  The hotel looks amazing, the weather is going to be
great, what more can you ask for?  Oh ya, there is more, some great
talks and presentations from Rubyists around the world!

</p>
<p>

There are a number of interesting presentations, but a a couple of them
really stand out.  One presentation that I'm really looking forward to
is '<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/18">Recovering from Enterprise:
how to embrace Ruby's idioms and say goodbye to bad habits</a>' by Jamis
Buck of <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>.  I really respect
the guys at 37, they have a no bullshit way of saying things that
<a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php">just make sense</a>,
I like that.  Jamis is also a long time Rubyist and has given so much to
the community with the projects he's worked on (capistrano, sqllite ruby
bindings), and has been teasing us with
<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1340-embrace-real-constraints-not-artificial-ones">interesting
blog posts</a> related to his presentation.

</p>
<p>

<br />I'm also interested in the talk Scott Chacon is giving,
'<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/8">Using Git in Ruby
Applications</a>' mainly because I find
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a> to be
such an in interesting source control system (and maybe I can pull some
of my co-workers along so Scott can infect them with the Git as well). 
It sounds like Scott is going to be getting into some very interesting
things with his presentation as well, such as using git as the backend
for a ruby based wiki or file backup system.  Cool stuff.

</p>
<p>

On Friday I'm probably going to try and catch Yehuda Katz presentation,
'<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/51">Writing Code That Doesn't Suck:
Interface P=Oriented Design</a>' since, if you've read any of my
<a href="/2008/09/24/make-it-suck-less/">other</a>
<a href="/2008/10/29/ec2-makes-getting-a-startup-going-suck-less/">blog</a>
<a href="/2008/10/21/making-input-fields-suck-less/">posts</a>, I really
like to do as much as possible to make things suck less.  I'm not all
that interested in Merb though so I may wander over to
'<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/50">Ruby Heavy-Lifting: Lazy load
it, Event it, Defer it, and then Optimize it.</a>' by Ilya Griorik and
see what he has to say beacause, really, can you every know enough about
making you code and application run faster?  Didn't think so.

</p>
<p>

Anyways, that's just a short run down on some of the great presentations
that are going to be happening this weekend.  There will also be
appearances by Matz (the creator of Ruby) and Dave Thomas (Pragmatic
Programmers), both are likely to have something interesting to say.

</p>
<p>

See you in Orlando!
