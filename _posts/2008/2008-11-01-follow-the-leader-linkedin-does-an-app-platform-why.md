This past week saw something we've seem
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/">before</a>,
<a href="http://mashable.com/2007/12/11/bebo-platform/">again</a> and
<a href="http://mashable.com/2008/02/04/myspace-developer-platform-launches/">again</a>,
with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a> launching it's
<a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2008/10/28/announcing-applications-on-linkedin/">application
platform</a>.  The big question is why, what's the point?  Their team is
pushing it as professional applications for things like sharing book
reviews, documents, and extended communication options.

</p>
<p>

Okay, that's cool, but most of the people you generally connect with on
Linkedin are professional peers, if you had a need for this you're
probably already doing it with something like IM or google docs.  Since
Linkedin is a professional network it doesn't really lend itself to the
type of viral
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9727759-2.html">sheep
throwing applications</a> that made the Facebook platform so popular.

</p>
<p>

Now, the thing I'm really wondering is why it took them almost a year
from
<a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2007/12/10/the-intelligent-2/">announcing
the platform</a> (about 5 months after the Facebook platform took off)
and actually
<a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2008/10/28/announcing-applications-on-linkedin/">releasing
it</a>.  To me it seems like the first post on their platform was a load
of crap and they were just trying to grab onto a bit of the hype that
Facebook had generated.  On top of this almost every application I tried
to use gave me some sort of error or had information flowing outside of
the visible area for the application.  I expect more from such a
<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/linkedin">high profile
company</a> with over a year of development time.

</p>
<p>

This doesn't make Linkedin suck less, if anything it makes them suck
more because it seems like all their doing is running after the
successful ideas from other companies.  If it doesn't make it suck less,
don't do it.
