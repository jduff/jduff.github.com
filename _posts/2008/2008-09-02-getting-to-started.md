This is the story of how I finally got around to signing up to a
blogging service and getting that first post up there.  It isn’t all
that exciting; there wasn’t any lighting, an explosion or even a bear
attack, but this is my blog and my story so I’m going to tell it.

About a year ago things finally clicked together that as a software
developer I should probably be showcasing my work and what I know,
building a brand as it were.  It had nothing to do with the
<a href="http://inspired.entrepreneur.com/2007/11/05/how-can-you-build-your-brand-with-a-blog/">countless</a>
<a href="http://kalsey.com/2003/06/build_your_brand/">posts</a> on

your online
<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/06/09/how-to-build-your-personal-brand-through-your-blog/">brand,</a>
it just came to me.  I swear.  Around this same time I came across a
couple of developers talking about how building your blogging engine is
a good way to showcase your work and try out new ideas with your
development (can’t find any links anymore).  This really appealed to me;
there’s always something new coming along and work isn’t always the best
place to try every shiny thing.  So I got started.  About a year ago.

<p>

I got going at a fair clip on things, was working with the latest
version of Rails (2.0 at that time) which was neat because they’ve added
a lot of <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/81">interesting</a>
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brynary/whats-new-in-rails-2/">things</a>,
but then life pulled me away.  I
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/2820011262/">got
married</a>, so a lot of time was spent planning that, we
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/2737074670/in/photostream/">bought
a house</a> and we even moved in.  It’s been a crazy year.  Even with
everything going on I’d still try and pull a minute or two away to work
on things.  I even managed a pretty decent design and logo.

Then I read
<a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/08/be-your-start-up.html">this
article</a> by Jay Fields, someone I really respect within the rails
community, on blogging.

Hm.  Ya, shit, he’s right.  It’s been fun playing around with building
the blog, but I wasn’t getting anywhere (though I did end up with a 17
message thread in gmail of post ideas).

</p>
<p>

With my new direction I did some research and decided on using
<a href="http://www.typepad.com">Typepad</a> to host my blog.  Now
things aren’t quite how I’d like them (I don’t have full control over
the html with the plan I got) but hey, at least I’m here.
