When <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> released their
application platform
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/">last
year</a> it was revolutionary and a slew of businesses popped up out of
nowhere.  A number of these business got huge valuations and
<a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2007/07/11/facebook-vc-were-investing-in-facebook-apps-too/">outside
funding</a>, some even made some money.  But now that the dust has
settled from the landgrab and the competitors have caught up with their
own offerings (with a
<a href="http://blueprintcode.typepad.com/blueprint_code/2008/11/follow-the-leader---linkedin-does-an-app-platform-why.html">varying
degree of success</a>) what's next for the app platform?  Well, from
where I sit, it looks like it's being retired.

</p>
<p>

The 'beta' features such as the
<a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Data_Store_API_documentation">Data
Storage apis</a> have had almost no movement in over a year, the api
itself hasn't had any drastic changes (except for the ones do to the new
layout) in months, what's been going on?  It used to be that notices
would be posted on a weekly basis about updates and new features, now
there's nothing.  The chatter around the Facebook platform is dying down
to a dull hum.

</p>
<p>

Applications are pushed out of the main page, multiple clicks away, the
directory is bloated with thousands and thousands of pointless
applications, how are you supposed to make a mark?  Facebook started out
with an 'anything goes' policy for applications, when things started
turning into a blue and white version of Myspace they realized their
mistakes and clamped down on the restrictions making it impossible for
new applications to break in.

Facebooks Solution:  Facebook Connect

</p>
<p>

<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=108">Connect</a>
seems to be the solution to the broken application platform.  Instead of
embedding your application into Facebook you can now have users login
through your website to Facebook and allow your application to access
their data.  So basically all their doing is Single Sign On and a
standard api to access the users data.  What's revolutionary about
this?  Nothing.  That
<a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/10/facebook_future">$15
billion dollar valuation</a> is seeming more ridiculous every day.

</p>
<p>

This doesn't mean Facebook applications are totally useless now, it just
means there aren't going to be any business built solely on a Facebook
app anymore.  Since the spotlights moved on, Facebook needs to work at
becoming cash flow positive to make keep things rolling, unless they
they can build another
<a href="http://www.mondaynightcrew.com/issues/comic_0065.html">Hype
Machine</a> to bring back the interest.
