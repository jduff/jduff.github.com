<p>So, I've finally started blogging, this is something I've been wanting to do for almost a year now but work and life have managed to keep me too busy up to now.&nbsp; This is my first post here so It makes sense to tell you a little about who I am and what I'm interested in so you know what you're getting into by reading this blog.&nbsp; It feels a little strange though, logically I should introduce myself right at the start but right now there's no one listening so does it really matter?&nbsp; Anyways, hopefully someone will someday go back into the archives and find this introductory post helpful.</p>

<p>My name is John Duff, I live in Canada's capital city, Ottawa and work full time as a Software Developer.&nbsp; I graduated Carleton University in 2006 from Software Engineering.&nbsp; I'm currently working with Ruby and Rails for the most part but have done a fair bit of Java, .Net, Javascript and Flex programming as well.&nbsp; At the moment I have a bit of a fixation with FriendFeed and various other Social
Media outlets and am very interested in what is happening with cloud computing. I'm also dabbling in design (photoshop, illustrator,
css) a bit more as well as keeping up with what is happening in the
Ruby community.</p>
