I subscribed to the blog
<a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/">Usability Post</a> last week and
have already come to love it.  There's a pile of content on this site,
all geared towards making your products more user friendly.  There's
everything you can think of here, from general ideas on using
<a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2008/10/17/categories-vs-tags/">categories
vs tags</a>, to specific hints or tricks like how to
<a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2008/09/22/automatically-select-form-input-field-on-page-load/">automatically
select and input field on page load</a>.

One particular article was published last week that caught my eye on
<a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2008/10/15/css-tip-remove-mac-osx-glowing-blue-outlin-for-custom-styled-input-fields/">how
to remove the OS X glowing blue outline for custom styled input
fields</a>.  This tip is great.  It's simple, it doesn't change the
world, it doesn't disrupt anything, but it makes your app suck a whole
lot less for the end user.

Check out the post, <a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/">subscribe to
the blog</a> and start using these ideas to make your applications suck
less, because really, who likes a sucky app?
