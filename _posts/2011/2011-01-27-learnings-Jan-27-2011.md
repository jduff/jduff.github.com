Wow, it’s been a long time since I’ve posted some learnings. Or anything
for that matter. Well, I’ve been saving them up so here’s a few from a
little while back. Hopefully I’ll be getting back into the swing of
things and start writing some real posts. For now, this is it.

-   When doing a screen recoding with Quicktime in Snow Leopard before
    starting the recording there’s a little drop down to the right that
    can be used to select which microphone to use. A nice walkthrough
    can be found
    <a href='http://www.icreatemagazine.com/tips/tutorial-record-your-screen-in-quicktime-x/'>here</a>.

* with jQuery.extend the first hash is modified, the result is also returned:{% highlight javascript %}
jQuery.extend({"one":"one", "two":"two"}, {"two":"three"}...) => {"one":"one", "two":"three"}
{% endhighlight %}

-   -k option to IExplorer will start it in full screen kiosk mode

<!-- -->

-   ActionController::Base.helpers gives you access to the Rails html
    helpers (div\_for, content\_tag, etc)

<!-- -->

-   link\_to “something”, :controller=\>:something, :action=\>“…” will
    map to :controller=\>“devise/something” if called when rendering a
    devise view. Use dynamic helper methods (ex. something\_path) to get
    around this issue.
