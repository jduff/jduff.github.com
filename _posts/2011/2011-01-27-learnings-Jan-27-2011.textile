Wow, it's been a long time since I've posted some learnings. Or anything for that matter. Well, I've been saving them up so here's a few from a little while back. Hopefully I'll be getting back into the swing of things and start writing some real posts. For now, this is it.


* When doing a screen recoding with Quicktime in Snow Leopard before starting the recording there's a little drop down to the right that can be used to select which microphone to use. A nice walkthrough can be found <a href='http://www.icreatemagazine.com/tips/tutorial-record-your-screen-in-quicktime-x/'>here</a>.

* with jQuery.extend the first hash is modified, the result is also returned:{% highlight javascript %}
jQuery.extend({"one":"one", "two":"two"}, {"two":"three"}...) => {"one":"one", "two":"three"}
{% endhighlight %}

* -k option to IExplorer will start it in full screen kiosk mode

* ActionController::Base.helpers gives you access to the Rails html helpers (div_for, content_tag, etc)

* link_to "something", :controller=>:something, :action=>"..." will map to :controller=>"devise/something" if called when rendering a devise view. Use dynamic helper methods (ex. something_path) to get around this issue.
