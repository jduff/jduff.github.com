Learnings for the past week. It was a busy one.

* rvm uninstall leaves build files
** rvm remove gets rid of everything
* Firefox on Ubuntu gets thin black borders around images that are resized in html/css
** Adding some transparency to the edges of the images fixes 
* rails i18n translation keys can't have '.' in them, even if escaped
* -webkit-user-select/-moz-user-select:none; to disable selection on a webpage
* Webkit doesn't allow keyboard entry to 0 height inputs
* Firefox and Webkit don't allow keyboard entry to invisible inputs (display:none)
* jQuery fadeOut doesn't work on some (circle, line) svg elements in Webkit
* jQuery.keypad on multiple inputs should check if the keyboard target is changing before updating the keypad (huge performance gains)
* git cherry lists commits that don't exist in another branch. Compares the changeset, not commit ids
* gem install -f will install gem even if dependencies can't be met
* apt-get build-dep ruby1.8 will get you all the ruby build dependencies
* git checkout -t -b BRANCH origin/BRANCH will checkout and track a remote branch
